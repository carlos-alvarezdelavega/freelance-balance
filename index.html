                * If you do not have access to WhatsApp, you can still take part in the study by sharing your activities

            <p>Yes. Your name will not be written on any of the data we collect; the written information you provide

              or documents resulting from this study. All the data collected from you in this study will be
              confidential, taking especial care of any media you might share during the activity captures. The only
              exception to this confidentiality is if the researcher feels that you or others may be harmed if
