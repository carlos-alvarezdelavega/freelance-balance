            <p>Once you have completed the registration survey, we'll invite you to a short interview to
              explain the study activities. In the interview, the lead researcher will reiterate the purposes of the
              study and clarify any questions you might have. This
              interview will last between 15-30 minutes and will take place over Microsoft Teams or Skype at a time of
              your convenience.</p>

                Activities
              </h2>
              <p>Starting the day after the on-boarding interview, you will be asked to complete a series of short,
                daily activities for 10 days, which should not take you more than 5 minutes. The activities will consist
                of sharing your views on aspects of your day through WhatsApp. You will receive one activity prompt and
                one reminder per day on WhatsApp; you should complete the activities whenever it is most convenient for
                you, and not when you get the reminders. You can respond to these activities using different formats,
                such as taking photos, recording voice notes, filming yourself, or simply typing down your answers.
                <br></br>
                * If you do not have access to WhatsApp, you can still take part in the study by sharing your activities
                via email.

              <p>After completing the work-life balance activities, you will take part in a follow-up interview within a
                week from the end of the activities. The purpose of this interview is to talk through your experience
                with the study, provide more details, and more contextual explanations. The interview will last between
                60-90 minutes and will take place over Microsoft Teams or Skype at a date and time of your convenience.

            <p>Yes. Your name will not be written on any of the data we collect; the written information you provide

              confidential, taking especial care of the information you share through the activities. The only
